## Welcome

:+1::tada: First off, I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help improve the ODKConvert and it's integration with FMTM! :tada::+1:

We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels and we are committed to making sure your participation is inclusive, enjoyable and rewarding. If you have never contributed to an open source project before, we are a good place to start and will make sure you are supported every step of the way. If you have **any** questions, please ask!

There are many ways to contribute to this repo:

## Testing

Adding test cases, or simply testing out existing functionality.

## Report bugs and suggest improvements

The [issue queue](https://github.com/hotosm/odkconvert/issues) is the best way to get started. There are issue templates for BUGs and FEATURES that you can use, or you can create your own. Once you have submitted an issue, it will be assigned one label out of the following [label categories](https://github.com/hotosm/odkconvert/labels). If you are wondering where to start, you can filter by the good first issue label.

## Code contributions

Create pull requests (PRs) for changes that you think are needed. We would really appreciate your help!
