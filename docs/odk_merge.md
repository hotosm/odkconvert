# odk_merge.py

This program conflates the data collected using ODK Collect with
existing OSM data. Many buildings in OSM were from imports of AI
derived building footprints, and the only tags are
_building=yes_. When doing ground data collection, in addition to
collecting new data, you want to add or correct tags in existing OSM
data.

The file of collected data is downloaded as a CSV file from ODK Central.
Then it's converted to OSM XML using **CSVDump.py**. Once converted,
to OSM XML format, all tags can be merged or added to existing OSM
data.

## Usage

    usage: odk_merge.py [-h] [-v] [-c ODKFILE] [-f OSMFILE] [-o OUTFILE] [-b BOUNDARY]

    This program conflates ODK data with existing features from OSM.

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose         verbose output
    -c ODKFILE, --odkfile ODKFILE - ODK CSV file downloaded from ODK Central
    -f OSMFILE, --osmfile OSMFILE - OSM XML file created by odkconvert
    -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE - Output file from the merge
    -b BOUNDARY, --boundary BOUNDARY - Boundary polygon to limit the data size

The boundary file is a polygon to limit the dataset size, useful when
using downloaded OSM data for entire countries, or using a large
database. Most ODK data files are not usually very large. It can be in
any format, but GeoJson is the most common one.

To specify a database as the OSM source, the input file gets prefixed
with _pg:_, followed by the database name. Otherwise use a disk
file.

The ODK source is an OSM XML file created by _CSVDump.py_, where all the
tags have been converted from the ODK Central submission download. The
output file is in OSM XML format, and contains modified entries where
existing data has the new tags added.

## Examples

### Example 1: Merge ODK data into an existing OSM file:

    odk_merge.py -f /path/to/existing.osm -c /path/to/odk_data.csv -o /path/to/output.osm

This command will merge the data collected through ODK into the existing.osm file, adding new tags or updating existing ones based on the data in the odk_data.csv file. The resulting merged data will be written to the output.osm file.

### Example 2: Merge ODK data into an existing OSM file within a specific boundary:

    odk_merge.py -f /path/to/existing.osm -c /path/to/odk_data.csv -o /path/to/output.osm -b /path/to/boundary.geojson

This command is similar to the previous one, but it limits the merged data to the area defined by the boundary.geojson file.

### Example 3: Merge ODK data into an existing OSM database:

    odk_merge.py -f pg:osm -c /path/to/odk_data.csv -o /path/to/output.osm

This command merges the ODK data into an existing OSM database instead of a file. The pg:osm argument specifies the name of the OSM database.

### Example 4: Merge ODK data into an existing OSM database within a specific boundary:

    odk_merge.py -f pg:osm -c /path/to/odk_data.csv -o /path/to/output.osm -b /path/to/boundary.geojson

This command is similar to the previous one, but it limits the merged data to the area defined by the boundary.geojson file.
